# Career Readiness

## Week 1 - Professional goals and personal brand

### 1. Check your skills

For this part, you will need to write down each project you have worked on. It can be a Hackathon project, and you will need to write the following information for each.

- [ ] The technologies we used,
- [ ] what we learned,
- [ ] what we would do differently,
- [ ] will we do it again?

### 2. What roles are we aiming to achieve

Create a list of job titles that interest you from LinkedIn and job boards.

Your homework is to create a list of jobs that caught your eye and look for patterns. For each job post, you will need this info:

- [ ] Skills needed
- [ ] Skills desired
- [ ] Responsibilities

### 3. What we have and what we're missing

Identify the skills you already have and skills you need to learn.
